# Eventbrite to Hatchbuck API Triggers

This application should use the [Eventbrite API](http://developer.eventbrite.com/doc/) to listen for new event attendees and send a request to the [Hatchbuck API](https://hatchbuck.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/5000578765-hatchbuck-api-documentation) to create/update a contact with the attendee information and create a new product purchase record for that attendee.

- [Eventbrite Event Attendees](https://developer.eventbrite.com/docs/event-attendees/)
- [Sample Hatchbuck New Product Request](http://pastebin.com/h25jwnaU)

The application should run on a standard LAMP or Node.js stack on Digital Ocean.
